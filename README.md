# ASHL
An Adaptive Multi-stage Distributed Deep Learning Training Scheme for Heterogeneous Environments

PS is implemented by using RPC of pytorch.

Four classic training methods are implemented: ASP, BSP, SSP and Local SGD.

Implemented ADSP, derived from AAAI paper Distributed Machine Learning through Heterogeneous Edge Systems in 2020.

ASHL accelerates existing distributed training schemes by 27\%-71.8\% in heterogeneous environments.
